# 🧠 Mental Health Care Application

A mobile mental health support system built to monitor patient progress between clinical visits, reduce gaps in care, and provide real-time communication between doctors, patients, counselors, and guardians. Designed with suicide prevention as a core objective by ensuring continuous monitoring, timely medication reminders, instant emotional support, and data-driven clinical decisions.

## 📋 About the Project

Traditional mental health care relies heavily on periodic clinic visits, leaving critical gaps in patient monitoring. This application bridges those gaps by capturing daily patient data — mood, sleep, water intake, and medication adherence — and surfacing it to clinicians in an interactive analytics dashboard.

Four roles work together in the system. An admin who is a responsible role in a hospital can creates and manages all accounts through a web dashboard. Doctors prescribe medications, view patient analytics, and manage appointments. Patients log daily health data, access their prescriptions, and connect instantly with a counselor when they need support. Guardians independently observe and log the patient's condition, providing a third-party perspective that helps doctors detect masked distress. Counselors receive real-time notifications when a patient requests support and can begin a chat session immediately.

The system runs automated push notifications for medication reminders, appointment alerts, water intake, and diary prompts — ensuring patients stay on their care plan even between visits.
